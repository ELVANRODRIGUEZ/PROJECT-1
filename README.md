# **YOU IN THE UNIVERSE**

**DESCRIPTION**

This is a bootcamp first milestone project. It asks the user to enter birth information to retrieve Wester, Chinese and Egyptian horoscopes. The first one is gotten from an open source API, but the last two are hard coded and thus, they are not dynamic, but date calculations need to be done with MomentJs to link the data, which is stored in Firebase, to the input birth date. Additionally, and more importantly, astronomic informations are given to the user also based on his/her birth data; Last birthday earth pictures; Solar explosions that occurred the closest to the user last decade transition (or birth if he/she is younger than 10 years); Solar and moon info about the user birth date; Closest to earth asteroids at user's birth date; and finally, a set of pictures from NASA's 'Picture of the day' archive. Almost all info is retrieved using different NASA's APIs.
