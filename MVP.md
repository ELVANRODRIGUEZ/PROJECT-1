# Group Do: Designing your MVP

## Instructions
* With your group, answer each of the following questions:
  1. Who is your target audience?
        People deeply interested (fanatics) on Astrology and how it affects their lifes (as far as they are convinced).
        A probable age range would be from 18 to 45; and probably mostly women (around 70%-30%). This web is mostly intended for people with spiritual active interests.

  2. What is the problem that the product will address?
        The product will be API driven, so the main goal of the MVP development will be to find the proper information through them. Selecting the appropiate ones will be challenging. A good scientific background of what the user searched most be likend from an API like NASA's. The web app will try to manage that linking behind the scenes in the most informative way. Also, the interface will try catch and drive the user's attention to scientific substantial information about what they searched.

  3. What is the primary goal of the product?
        Nobody denies that Astrology is such an intriguig matter, but such is Astronomy, and is commonly underated. We will attempt to bring the latter to its fair aknowledgment. The web app will try to provide an extra amount of extremely valuable information about what the user searched, extendign his/her knowledge about it.

  4. Identify and prioritize essential user stories (limit this to 3 or fewer)?
        1. As a user, I want to now as much as possible about the Astrologic phenomenas that affect my living.
        2. As a user, I want to be able to be able to understand what lies beyond the common Astrological info I commonly search.
        3. As a user, I want to have a great looking infograph of the Astrological/Astronomical info I am interested in. 

* Remember, your MVP should be the absolute *minimum* product that you need to pitch your idea to investors (or your classmates). Think bare essentials.

* As an example, the essential features of an instagram-like application might look like:

  1. As a user, I want to post pictures so that I can share my life.
  2. As a user, I want to be able to search for other users so that I can find their list of images.
  3. As a user, I want to be able to view other people's images so that I can keep up with what's happening in their lives. 

* Things like liking photos, sending photos to friends, making instagram stories, etc are cool, but they aren't essential. They should **not** be part of the MVP.
